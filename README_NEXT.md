# Aaj Kya Banaye? (Next.js App Router)

This scaffold is a minimal Next.js App Router project with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion components for the "Aaj Kya Banaye?" app.

Quick start (from project root):

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

Notes:
- The API route `/api/suggest` uses a small dataset in `lib/recipes.js` and returns match-based results.
- Components are in `components/` and pages are in `app/`.
- For full feature parity you can expand the dataset and implement server-side AI integrations.
